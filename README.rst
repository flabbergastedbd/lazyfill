lazyfill
########

A small javascript library to make repetitive tasks like filling bug tracker details easier with some help
from TamperMonkey.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Install TamperMonkey addon.
2. Create a new tamper script from one of the `samples`_.
3. Create templates as you need.

For samples, have a look at `samples`_. Combining those samples gives you some powerful primitives. If you wish to see more
functionality, have a loot at `lazyfill.api.js`_ to see what methods can be used.

.. _samples: samples/
.. _lazyfill.api.js: lazyfill.api.js
