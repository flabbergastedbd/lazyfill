lazyfill
########

A small javascript library to make repetitive tasks like filling bug tracker details easier with some help
from ViolentMonkey. It is like your browser autofill, except that highly templated and supremely customizable.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Install ViolentMonkey addon.
2. Create a new tamper script from one of the `samples`_.
3. Add templates as you need.
4. Autofill triggers will show up on the script commands in the addon menu.

For samples, have a look at `samples`_. Combining those samples gives you some powerful primitives. If you wish to see more
functionality, have a loot at `lazyfill.api.js`_ to see what methods can be used.

.. _samples: samples/
.. _lazyfill.api.js: lazyfill.api.js
